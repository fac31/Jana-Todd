      <h1 class="accent">Welcome to the Intergalactic Travel Agency.</h1>
      <p>So you think you have what it takes. You've finished your BTEC in UFO engineering, your mum's packed you
        sandwiches (just how you like them, in triangles with the crust's off), and now you think you're ready to
        experience the 0 gravity lifestyle.</p>
      <p>
        But what your delightful sandwich-making mother didn't bring to the table was a jar of marmite; not only the
        crucial last step in making your sandwhich delightful, but also central in keeping your galatactic TomTom running
        smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks Mum, instead of heading to Mars I'm barrelling towards the Sun at lightspeed.</p>

      <h3>This is where we come in.</h3>
      <p>Long gone are the days where you could simply pick up your edition of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' and set
        about on your merry way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh no, the universe has changed since then; long gone are the days of typewriters, printers, IOS, and
        Doo-Hickey450's - Welcome to the 32nd century grandpa.
        If you wanna give this a shot and keep all your cyber-limbs in one piece, your going to want to speak to us.
