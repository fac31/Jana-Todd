    <p>Our customers are valuable to us. Not simply because they line our pockets with large sums of cash, but they usually (and it really is more often than not, honestly you wouldn't believe what parents let their kids get away with these days) sport amusing haircuts which we can point and laugh at as we blast them into the void.<br>
    See what they have to say about our impeccable services below.</p>

        <p>Where to start; I could lead with being beheaded by the Bork-a-naughts one week into the cruise, or should I begin with the water-boarding on planet Xing-Gong-32T that I received instead?<br> The marmite was useless and I didn't even get to bite into my second egg. Would not recommend, daylight robbery and they have the cheek to make you pay for parking.</p>

        <p>Absolute lunatic. The guy has no idea what's going on, he rambles on about someone named Hugo Drax and shoots anything that moves; worst tour guide EVER.</p>
