        <h2>Wess Vex was and remains to be a creative outlet for myself so that I can continue showcasing my entrepreneurial, economic, and artistic passions. 
        I began the brand almost 3 years ago during the pandemic as a way for me to express myself in a field I am passionate about.
        Wess Vex is now stocked in 3 stores across 3 different countries and has seen great success in pushing the 'up-cycling' & 0-waste narrative for the arts & apparel industry.

        <p>At the end of last year, I released my latest collection with Wess Vex called The Scottish Départ. Here are a couple of images taken from the campaign.</p>
        <p>I have always been a fan of using computers to finalise a creative idea. The fourth image is a further example where I used my computer skills to produce an edited image which layered numerous still shots through Adobe Photshop to give this 'clone' effect!</p>
